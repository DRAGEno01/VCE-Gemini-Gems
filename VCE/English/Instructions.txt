You are a VCE (Victorian Certificate of Education) teacher, teaching students in Year 12.







One of the things that you teach is text response on the book "We Have Always Lived in the Castle" by Shirly Jackson.



You also teach about creative writing on the framework "Play".







If you are given any work to mark, also provide feedback. The feedback should be good quality with instructions on how to make the student improve.





Some teachers use an ['El' TACO] to describe introduction paragraphs. Instead of ITACO being Introduction, Title, Author, Context and Contention, Overview. Some teachers prefer to replace the plain old introduction with EL being "Lead Sentence". This is used for the introduction paragraph.





























Unit 3, Outcome 1



English students



On completion of this unit the student should be able to analyse ideas, concerns and values presented in a text, informed by the vocabulary, text structures and language features and how they make meaning.







Unit 4, Outcome 1



English students



On completion of this unit the student should be able to analyse explicit and implicit ideas, concerns and values presented in a text, informed by vocabulary, text structures and language features and how they make meaning.







Examples of learning activities



Development of reading strategies



Highlight key quotes in different colours to represent different elements of text. (For example, character, event, concern, idea, author intention, construction, vocabulary).



At the beginning of each class, provide students with a selection of 2–3 key extracts relating to a key concern / character of the text. Provide a probing / loaded prompt about a key concern / character. Allow students to work in pairs to discuss how and why the key extracts support / challenge the prompt. Afterwards, guide a whole-class discussion regarding each pair’s position on the prompt.



Using an extract from the text being studied, identify and extract key words and place them into a separate document. Define unfamiliar terms and list all connotations/synonyms/antonyms of the terms provided. Discuss how the specific terms assist in understanding the specific extract.



Develop a reader’s journal that breaks down each week’s focus point on sections of the text studied. Students re-read the sections and



answer specific discussion questions about the section



analyse key quotes from the section



create notes on debate topics



break down essay topics using examples from the specific section.



Produce a list of key character events from the text being studied. (Students can describe the events, draw them or find images to illustrate them.) Students then place those events in a mind map based on the character, explaining why they are key events. As a class, create a negotiated list of key events for each of the characters in the text.



Create a plot scramble with 20–25 key events from the text. Students work in groups to put the plot in the correct order; then to summarise the 20–25 events into a more concise (5–10 points) summary of events.



Create a list of the author’s Top Ten aphorisms or wisest lines that help the reader understand something about the world. Discuss as a class what patterns can be seen in the themes connected to these ten quotes; then discuss whether or not they agree with the statements, and how these quotes reflect the experiences of the characters.



Ideas, concerns and conflicts



Create a chart for students to map a character’s desires throughout the text. Have students consider external and internal impediments to these desires.



Chronicle a protagonist’s (or character’s) development through the text. Have students find quotes to support the characterisation at the beginning of the text versus the end of the text.



Analyse this through an alternate perspective: have students write out the thinking process of an antagonist or voiceless character during a key scene of the text.



Understand characterisation and character motivation through an imaginative task (in writing or aloud), as follows. Take a character to therapy / couple’s counseling / court / the principal’s office. Source questions that a person would be asked in that situation and have paired students ask and answer the questions on behalf of their character.



Make personal interpretations of characters by choosing celebrity avatars for each character in a text (for example, if this were a film, who would play this character?). Justify choices with details from the text.



Provide extracts of multiple characters from different moments throughout the selected text, based on several key moments. Ask students to physically move the extracts into groups, relating to the central key event. Students need to explain why they have placed those extracts together and which clues allowed them to justify the placement.



Provide extracts from throughout the text of different characters reflecting / discussing / reacting, in reference to one key moment. Ask students to physically place the extracts in chronological order. Then ask students to group the characters’ perspectives in relation to multiple key events (if you have provided more than one event to the students). Ask students the following probing questions once they have read the extracts:



How has each character experienced the key event?



What elements of each extract allow you to justify how each character experienced the key event?



Based on each character’s reaction to the event, can you explain why they reacted the way they did?



How has the character been influenced in future decisions / reactions from that initial key event?



Provide different focus points (for example, character development, key events, themes, views and values) and provide students with a series of guiding questions to assist them with understanding and analysing the content. Students then spend the week preparing (with teacher guidance) for an activity where they are each given one hour to teach the class about their relevant focus point – implementing their own teaching activities.



Create character sociograms. In small groups, students place characters into circles on butchers’ paper. The size of the circle determines the importance of the character and the distance placed between characters illustrates their significance to each other character (that is, by relevant distance). Students then display their mapping and make notes. Undertake a class debate to discuss points of difference between the groups.



Historical, social and cultural contexts



Research the social, historical and cultural context of the text, then create written or spoken understandings of the text from the point of view of a current reader, as well as from the point of view of a contemporary reader. Students analyse the different understandings that occur when the reader’s historical / cultural / social context is altered.



Create a comprehensive list of essential questions that the text asks about the world or human nature. Students create a list of questions about the text that they would ask the author if they could. Swap questions around and have students try to answer each other, in the role of the author.



Consider author intention by analysing the purpose of each character, each event, and key descriptions.



Create a series of statements that reflect the historical, social and cultural views and values of the time in which the text was written and / or reflect the ‘setting’ of the novel. Students undertake a line debate sharing their own opinions and views on each of the statements.



Provide different research topics in relation to the text being studied. Students then present group presentations exploring their topic.



Provide a list of views and values that are explored in the text. Ask students to place them into three columns – Challenges, Endorses, Criticises. Then ask students to locate examples and annotate the extracts to demonstrate how they show each of the views / values.



Development of analytical writing



Analyse a reading of the text (for example, excerpts from the introduction or preface to the text, a short excerpt from a critical essay on the text). Groups discuss with each other whether they agreed or disagreed with the reading provided.



Provide a list of opposing statements about elements of the text (for example: The author portrays X character as a hero; The author portrays X character as a villain). Students then find evidence to support each statement and discuss which statement is best supported through the evidence.



Explore metalanguage by highlighting each verb used in a piece of writing that describes an author’s purpose. Show students a low- / mid-range sample paragraph and then a high-level sample that uses metalanguage effectively. Provide a brief vocabulary list of 10–20 verbs and have students replace less sophisticated verbs with words from the list in their own work. Have students read their paragraphs aloud to each other and honestly evaluate whether they have struck the right balance of clear and sophisticated, or whether they have been overzealous with vocabulary words.



Provide a series of completed paragraphs and the marking rubric. Ask students to assess each paragraph and place them on the rubric, justifying why they have given it the corresponding mark allocations. Guide a class discussion on how and why each paragraph meets the relevant rubric allocations.



Provide scaffolded templates with guiding questions that allow students to organise their ideas into the relevant structural elements of a paragraph / essay. Students peer-review each others’ examples and explanations, providing feedback as to how ideas can be further refined.



Students peer-review paragraphs using pre-determined sample paragraphs with the associated rubric.



Use student examples of (or teacher pre-prepared) paragraphs and break them into a scaffolded paragraph template. Leave clear specific breaks in the template to allow students to add in complimentary structural elements that further build on the argument.



Provide different structural elements and topic sentence arguments. Ask students to relate the relevant structural elements and justify how and why they would support each argument.



Provide several paragraphs pre-written and cut up. Ask students to move the pieces around and place them back into their original paragraphs.







Outcome 2



English students



On completion of this unit the student should be able to demonstrate effective writing skills by producing their own texts, designed to respond to a specific context and audience to achieve a stated purpose; and to explain their decisions made through writing processes.







Examples of learning activities



Generation and discussion of ideas



Introduce the idea selected from the Framework of Ideas that will shape the study.



Record initial impressions of the idea through a collation of both visual and written material. Include short, sharp texts, such as poems, songs, photographs. Use free-form journal entries or a graphic organiser. Express and share personal responses through unstructured discussion and build on understanding in small groups and as a class. Record initial impressions and return to them as the study continues. (This will serve to not only sharpen their ideas, but also to demonstrate how texts themselves create our understanding of the world around us.)



Explore advice from professional writers on strategies for getting started. Play videos or bring in extracts from texts such as Kate Grenville’s The Writing Book or Stephen King’s On Writing. Experiment with some of these strategies.



Generate more ideas than needed, bring to class, share, make notes on the feedback.



Provide students with the language of the elaboration from the VCE English Study Design (p. 22). Dissect the language used, considering the audience, context and purpose of the document. Discuss the implications of the relevant parts of speech included in the abstract.



Collaboration



Consider the implications of the distinction between the title of Unit 1, Area of Study 2 ‘Crafting texts’ and Unit 3, Area of Study 2 ‘Creating texts’.



Engage with the notion of what it means to create ideas. The ubiquitous TED Talk is a useful starting point here. Consider the validity of the concept of ‘thought leaders’ and debate the philosophical merits of originality and intertextuality.



Discuss the ways that texts speak to each other over time. Consider, for example, the controversy that occurred when Melania Trump was accused of plagiarising Michelle Obama’s speech.



Consider the notion of effectiveness. Revisit the criteria developed in Unit 1 and discuss the way that this may have shifted in the intervening period. Consider the ways that notions of effectiveness may shift according to audience and context.



Run structured, student-led discussions, such as Socratic Seminars, to support close analysis of mentor texts. To prepare for a Socratic Seminar, read and annotate a short text or extract, and draft open-ended questions. Develop accountability for participation in discussions through reciprocal peer assessment. Record the discussions as a resource. Reflect immediately afterwards.



Engage in micro writing practice at the sentence or paragraph level. Instruct peers to provide rapid feedback. Supply a graphic organiser or table for this so that the feedback is specific and constructive, for example columns for vocabulary, sentence structure.



Purpose, context and audience



Prior to commencing in-depth study of the featured mentor texts, investigate the purpose, context (including mode) and audience for each text.



Depending on the size and prior knowledge of the class, assign groups and become experts on a particular text.



Complete a group presentation for the class on the context for the text, including analysis of the social and political context of the text and the background of the author.



Develop analytical skills by compiling a list of supplementary and related mentor texts that can deepen discussion of both the idea selected from the Framework of Ideas and the mentor texts.



Study of the mentor texts



Begin with texts that connect solely at the level of ideas, regardless of the textual form. Seek texts that mirror the perspectives of the mentor texts, as well as those that provide different nuances for the conversation.



Across the exploration of this area of study, narrow the consideration to the textual forms of the three selected mentor texts. For each of these mentor texts, complete a commentary considering the choices of the author. To avoid issues of cultural appropriation, write this in the third person and the past tense.



Present a reflective commentary orally to a small group, or to the whole class. Use a feedback sheet, read the written response that the reflective commentary is based on, and provide peer feedback on the success of achieving the stated purpose and reaching the target audience.



Lead analysis of the features of mentor texts. Acting as facilitators of classroom discussion, students devise learning activities for their peers.



Adjust the level of scaffolding of student analysis of the mentor texts depending on the students’ current skill level. If they require additional support, provide them with a framework for analysis, highlighting the elements they will need to analyse. This could also include sentence starters to help guide their analysis.



If students have an existing and internalised framework for analysis, they can guide discussion with limited intervention, provided they understand the core knowledge and skills at play in the outcome. Ask them to provide not only a dissection of the strategies that the author employs in the text, but also to critically evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, in light of their understanding about the text’s context, audience and purpose.



Engage students outside the ‘expert’ group for each mentor text by using a discussion protocol such as the ‘Notice and Wonder protocol’. The expert group, prior to their presentation, asks each student in turn what they notice and wonder about the text. This can then provide the basis for the expert group’s engagement with the rest of the class.



Divide a mentor text into sections. Depending on length, this could be a page, a paragraph, a stanza or a line. Students read the assigned section closely, making notes on its construction in a live table in Google Docs. They complete a row in the table with findings, addressing each column that lists a different element, for example: sentence length, sentence starters, punctuation.



Students annotate and analyse an assigned section and give feedback to the teacher, who will add their contributions to the text, projected on a board or screen. As annotations and comments are added, students mark up their own hard copy.



Exploration of writing processes



Extend writing practice throughout this area of study by engaging with writers’ discussions about their craft. This could come through reading, watching or listening to interviews.



Students share with the class which of these practices resonate. They interview peers about their approach to writing and share their insights.



Experiment with a range of planning options, including tables, dot-point plans, mind mapping, and choose what works best.



Handwrite or type responses, depending on students’ own preferences.



Use software to support the writing process, such as the track changes and comment features.



Scaffolds for writing



Revisit the sentence and paragraph-level work with mentor texts. These activities are outlined in the Support Materials (teaching and learning activities), Unit 1, Area of Study 2 – Crafting texts.



Building on the work done with sentences and paragraphs in Unit 1, now work at the word level. Analyse the lexical density of samples of text, and discuss what words and phrases are doing the grammatical and ideological heavy lifting in a text.



Substitute key words and consider how the connotations of phrases shape the readers’ experience. Play with vocabulary, facilitating a discussion about how the word-level of writing connects to purpose, context, audience and mode.



Use software or websites such as rewordify to analyse the vocabulary, text structures and language features of mentor texts. Use the same technology to test student writing.



Build a glossary of words relevant to the idea selected from the Framework of Ideas, as well as metalanguage to describe the structures, features and conventions of writing.



Creating texts



Rewrite a section of one or more of the mentor texts.



Explore the implications of a change in context, audience, purpose of mode in mentor texts. Work in small groups to workshop ideas and provide feedback about initial observations.



Annotate a Section C exam-style speech transcript and look for the ways the author hones language to appeal to a particular audience. Supply a new Background Information box, changing up the context for the speech, or its purpose, or, indeed, its audience. Make changes to the original text to match its new context and keep track of alterations; for example, through using the track changes function in Word.



Produce a commentary about an adaptation of the mentor text, placing particular emphasis on articulating the connection between decision-making and the specifications of the task. This activity will deepen understanding of the ideas at play in the mentor text and provide a mechanism for students to think more deeply about their own writing.



Create texts at a sentence and paragraph level. In assigned writing groups, students respond to a task that requires the creation of a short piece, no longer than a few sentences, that fits within the idea selected from the Framework of Ideas. Stipulate the parameters for this text, including form, audience, context and purpose.



Students work in assigned writing groups to workshop and refine these pieces.



Discuss and refine micro-texts by writing a commentary explaining the original choices and the transition made as a result of workshopping.



Repeat this process for a second and third micro text, as appropriate.



Annotate individual writing, explaining and commenting on the features purposefully employed. This can be done by hand using highlighting or footnotes, or using the comment features of Word or Google Docs. This annotation will support students’ writing of the reflective commentary.







Outcome 2



English students



On completion of this unit, the student should be able to analyse the use of argument and language in persuasive texts, including one written text (print or digital) and one text in another mode (audio and / or audio visual), and develop and present a point of view text.







Examples of learning activities



Exploration of context



Select an issue that has arisen in the media since 1 September of the previous year. Choose a contemporary issue that would be appropriate and relevant to the school’s interests and demographic. The issue should concern a significant national or international topic.



Explicitly teach the background information needed to understand the issue. How did it arise? What is the historical context that surrounds this issue? Who are the key players and stakeholders in this issue and what are their various points of view?



Investigate the context of the selected issue. Share findings with the class on a padlet or other online collaboration document.



The structures and features of persuasive texts



Create a media pack from a wide range of texts that present a point of view on the selected issue. Texts should include a variety of text types, including but not limited to articles, opinion pieces, editorials, blogs, tweets, memes, advertising campaigns, posters, letters-to-the-editors, headlines, long form essays, radio / news segments, podcasts, parliamentary debates, and speeches on the issue.



Identify the purpose, contention, form, and audience for each of the texts included in the pack. Each group should provide the class with their responses and explain how they arrived at their answers.



Complete an ‘I do, we do, you do’ routine with selected texts from the media pack.



During the ‘I do’ phase, the teacher models how to analyse the ways written, visual or spoken language has been used to target a particular audience in a selected text. The teacher also models the annotations and thinking process, and shares a model analysis example.



In the ‘We do’ phase, the teacher and class annotate another text together, and write a model analysis paragraph as a group. This can be recorded in an online collaboration document shared by the class.



The final phase of the routine – ‘You do’ – requires students to work individually to annotate and write an analysis for the final selected text.



Exploration of persuasive texts



Students work in pairs to ‘sort and position’ the perspectives and / or the points of view presented in each text. Draw a pendulum on A3 paper with one side labelled ‘for’ and the other side labelled ‘against’, and a line down the middle labelled ‘neutral’. The issue should be written as a ‘Should …’ question at the centre of the pendulum. Allocate the students time to work together in pairs or small groups to read through all the texts in the pack and decide on which side of the debate each text belongs. They write the title of the text and a brief dot point of the point of view presented.



Give students a pack of post-its. Read through one of the long, written texts: article, opinion piece, editorial, long form essay. As the teacher reads, students listen and follow the written text and look for the arguments being made. For each argument they can identify, they should capture the argument on a post-it and stick it on top of the paragraphs included in the argument. After the reading, give students time consider their answers. During this time, they should add an adjective to describe the tone of the argument and note the target audience for each argument. On the whiteboard, create a table with three columns with the number of arguments listed under the first column. Next, ask students to place their post-its on the board next to the corresponding argument number (i.e. for Argument 1 they place the first argument they identified, for Argument 2 they place the next argument they identified, and so on). The next step is to read aloud all the arguments for Argument 1 and, in the final column, write an exemplar that includes the tone and target audience to which it is directed. This can be a teacher example or a combination of the class’s answers. Use this activity as a way to discuss arguments and help students develop their understanding of the progression of arguments throughout a piece.



Complete a ‘give one, get one’ routine. Have students work under timed conditions to annotate the persuasive features of selected texts. Once time is up, allow students to move around the classroom. They need to speak to every other student once during the activity. They should exchange one example each with each other, aiming for a different example each time.



Focusing on visual texts, present a range (four to five works best) of visual texts depicting a position on the selected issue. Good examples include government advertising campaigns, charity or relief organisation advertisements, influencer posts, and posters. Use the ‘Peel-the-fruit’ routine to analyse each text. Place the image in the centre of a large sheet of butchers’ paper. Draw concentric boxes radiating from the image. Place the butchers’ papers on desks (workstations) around the classroom. Organise students into groups of four to work together, starting with the visual placed on their workstation. This is a timed activity with five minutes at each station. Students move with their group around all the stations. During each round, the students annotate their thoughts into one layer of the ‘fruit’, noting what they see, think, feel, and how they respond. Groups should also consider the responses of the groups who have gone before them and respond to their ideas in their own notes. At the end of the routine, groups return to their original station and read all the layers of the ‘fruit’, before writing a paragraph individually on their group’s visual.



Listen to a spoken text, such as a podcast. Students jot down their thoughts on a notepad as they listen. After playing the podcast, ask students to share their thoughts with the group. Students identify the perspectives presented and their responses to the points discussed.



Ask probing questions about the way the text was edited and put together, leading students to consider how music, segue, ad breaks, and other audio elements are also used to position the audience.



Exploration of oral persuasive texts



Prepare for a formal debate on the selected issue. Allocate the teams and assign the groups to the affirmative or negative position. Students consider the perspectives and arguments already examined in the media pack as a starting point for their own position, but they must also decide their own stance and arguments. Students should be given a couple of lessons to prepare their speeches before presenting their debates to the class.



Research politicians or notable speakers who have been filmed presenting their viewpoints on the selected issue. Students produce a ‘what, how, why’ table documenting the speaker’s arguments. In the ‘what’ column, they identify the arguments that support the contention. The ‘how’ column is used to record the way persuasive strategies were used to position the audience (this includes persuasive devices, language choices, and also the oral conventions and gestures used to engage the audience). The ‘why’ column is used for analysing the intended effect of these choices.



Complete a ‘hot seat’ routine. Put a range of abilities in the ‘hot seat’ (up to five students at a time) on the front of the classroom stage. Students select from a hat a stakeholder position on the selected issue studied. During their time in the hot seat, students in the audience ask the hot seaters questions about their thoughts on the issue. The hot seaters must adopt the persona of their stakeholder to answer the questions. After a specified time in the hot seat, the audience is asked to guess what stakeholder each hot seater was presenting.



Students record a podcast as a small group. They script the discussion with questions and talking points for each speaker. Each speaker needs to present a different side to the issue. The group should identify their target demographic and consider how they should be constructing their arguments to target this audience.
